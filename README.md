##### Setup the enviroment.

* Install php if not yet done so
`https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-php-on-windows/`

* Install composer.

`https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md`

* Import the database file, we should be able to expect from you how to do this.

`intern_test.sql`

* Make sure $serverName, $databaseName, $userName, $password are set correct in Connection.php.

* run `composer install` from your terminal in the root of the project.

* run `php commands.php` in the root of your project. If everything is done correctly you should have 1000 cars in your database.

##### Notes
* Your allowed to create as many files as you want.
* Make sure you don't put any private info in.

### Assignment 1
With all the example code you should be able to make a new table in the database called users. These users all have to be imported in the database. This also has to be done by calling `php command.php`

Use the example code and make sure not the break the other import.

### Assignment 2
Import `animals.xlsx` using `https://github.com/shuchkin/simplexlsx` this is a composer package.

Install it using the following command. `composer require shuchkin/simplexlsx`
If you can't get this to work, try to get a .csv file from animals.xlsx and import it the same way as you did at **Assignment 1**

#### Complete
* You can call this assignment complete when all imports work when calling `php commands.php`

### Deliverables
* Make sure to include all needed files, don't forget the sql file.
* Compile this project as a zip and mail it to your contactperson.
